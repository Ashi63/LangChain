makes the model output easier to parse and work with programmatically.

Why do we need Structured Output

Given them structured so that LLm can talk to other application.

Ways to get Structured Output

LLMs which can give the structured output:
with structured output 


Other LLMs which do not give structured output.
without structured output (so use of parsers)
