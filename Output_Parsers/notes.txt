Output Parsers:
Output Parsers in LangChain help convert raw LLM responses into structured formats like JSON, CSV, Pydantic models, and more.
They ensure consistency, validation, and ease of use in applications.

1. StrOutput Parser: The StrOutputParser is the simplest output parser in LangChain.
                     It is used to parse the output of a Language Model (LLM) and return it as a plain string.
2. Json Output Parsers
3. Structured Output Parsers: StructuredOutputParser is an output parser in LangChain that helps extract structured JSON
                        data from LLM responses based on predefined field schemas.
                        It works by defining a list of fields (ResponseSchema) that the model should return, ensuring
                        the output follows a structured format
4. Pydantic Output Parsers: 
                        What is PydanticOutputParser in LangChain?

                        PydanticOutputParser is a structured output parser in LangChain that uses Pydantic models to enforce schema validation when processing LLM responses.

                                ðŸš€ Why Use PydanticOutputParser?
                                âœ… Strict Schema Enforcement â†’ Ensures that LLM responses follow a well-defined structure.
                                âœ… Type Safety â†’ Automatically converts LLM outputs into Python objects.
                                âœ… Easy Validation â†’ Uses Pydanticâ€™s built-in validation to catch incorrect or missing data.
                                âœ… Seamless Integration â†’ Works well with other LangChain components.
